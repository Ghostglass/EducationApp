## How to contribute to this project

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Quickstart

First, clone this repository. Then:

```
bash
> bundle install
> bin/rails db:create
> bin/rails db:migrate

> bundle exec rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works
> bin/rails server # Start the server at localhost:3000<b>
```

## Troubleshooting

If you don't have Node.js installed yet, you might run into this error when running rspec:

```
ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable:
Could not find a JavaScript runtime. See https://github.com/rails/execjs for a list of available runtimes.
```

That is because Rails will use a Javascript runtime (such as Node) under the hood. The easiest way is to install Node by
running `brew install node` - and then run `bundle exec rspec` again.

## Database Domain Modelling

The above user stories parse into several classes. As per [Class Responsibility
Collaborator](http://agilemodeling.com/artifacts/crcModel.htm)<br>modelling, there are two obvious classes:<br>**User** and **Post**


**Post**.

Class: **Post**


  New_User_and New_content                 Many Posts
| ------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| Knows own content                     |
| Knows own posts                       |
| Knows own user_name                   |
| Knows own creation                    |
| Knows edit time_date                  |
| <!-- Knows own creation time and date -->          
| <!-- Knows edit time and date -->           

Class: **User**

| Responsibility | Collaborators |One_of many Users
| ------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Knows own user_name            |               |
| Knows own user_email           |               |
| Knows own password             |               |
| Knows own posts                |               |
| <!-- Knows own profile pic url Post -->        |

Class: **User**

| Responsibility       | Collaborators |
| -------------------- | ------------- |
| Knows own user_name  |               |
| Knows own user_email |               |
| Knows own password   |               |
| Knows own posts      | Post          |
|______________________________________|
<br>

### Each class needs its own table, each with columns<br>
corresponding to the responsibilities of each class.<br>

#### Ruby Object Modelling helps us carry this task forward.<b>

Table: **Users**

| user_id | user_name | user_email   | user*password* |
| ------- | --------- | -------------| -------------- |
| User1   | Aquaman   | aquaman@.com | â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢
| User2   |xx         | xxxx@.com    | â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢      | 
| User3   |xxx          xxxx@.com    | â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢â€¢          | 
_____________________________________|----------------|
|  Table: **Posts**
-------------------------------------
| post_id | user_id | post_content |
| ------- | ------- | ---------------|

<!-- Additional columns in Users: user_profile_pic, content_type -->
<!-- Additional columns in Posts: post_time, edit_time -->

## Feature & Unit Testing

Taking for example User Story 01 (`I would like to be able to sign up to Knowledge Pill`), this presupposes the ability to sign
up to become a user.

Creating these follows the TDD process:

1. Composition of pseudocode.
2. Composition of feature tests.
3. Composition of unit tests.
4. Composition of code.
5. Running of feature and unit tests.
6. Refactoring, and if necessary correction of code.
