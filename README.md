## How to contribute to this project
See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Quickstart

First, clone this repository. Then:

```bash
> bundle install
> bin/rails db:create
> bin/rails db:migrate

> bundle exec rspec # Run the tests to ensure it works
> bin/rails server # Start the server at localhost:3000
```

## Troubleshooting

If you don't have Node.js installed yet, you might run into this error when running rspec:

```ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable:
Could not find a JavaScript runtime.
See [ https://github.com/rails/execjs ] for a list of available runtimes.
```
That is because Rails will use a Javascript runtime (such as Node) under the hood.
The easiest way is to install Node by running `brew install node` -
and then run `bundle exec rspec` again.
