# Troubleshooting

## Good To Know: <br>
#### **Note in particular that you’ll need Ruby 2.6 or greater to run Rails 6. Ruby 2.7.0 should also work, but you may get some deprecation warnings, so some version of Ruby 2.6 is recommended. The current 'Knowledge Pill App' standardises on Ruby 2.7.0.)
<br>
If you don't have Node.js installed yet, you might run into this error when running rspec:
```
ExecJS::RuntimeUnavailable:
Could not find a JavaScript runtime.
See [ https://github.com/rails/execjs ] for a list of available runtimes.
 ```
That is because Rails will use a Javascript runtime (such as Node) under the hood.
The easiest way is to install Node by running `brew install node` -
and then run `bundle exec rspec` again.
