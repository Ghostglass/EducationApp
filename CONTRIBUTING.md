# Contributing to Knowledge Pill App

_The following is a described process that mirrors as closely as possible a typical dev team's development process, shortened to two days from a typical 1-, 2- or 4-week sprint._

### 2 Day Sprints

#### 1. Brainstorming Session, aka 'Meditation Monday'üßòüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è üìá
At 10 am, we kicked off the morning with the first planning session where we 'e-meet' with our newly assigned teammates. This is where the magic happens! We are assigned an app category to work with: At this early stage in the project, lots of thinking and planning happens.
<i>Ideas are spun, strung, interwoven, shot down, and sometimes 'pinned' in the 'Nice to Haves'.</i>
<br>A myriad concoction of organizational skills, creativity, design, collaboration, and planning was a focal point here. This also proved to be the perfect time to get to know your peers if you've never collaborated with them before.
Choose a number of unestimated tickets in `Unestimated`
  - Estimate the complexity of the tickets, perhaps using [story points](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/project-management/estimation) and note it on the cards
  - If the task was too big, we split it into smaller cards, and estimated those.
  - Decide, given your team's resources and the estimations on the cards, how many tasks/points the team can reasonably achieve in 2 days.
  - Move these  estimated cards into `To Do`
  - SMART GOALS: IS IT Specific? Measurable? Achievable? Realistic? Time bound?<br>
  <b>Everything can and must be broken down until it‚Äôs achievable.<b>


#### 2. Development
On our card wall, we would assign ourselves to a card in 'To do' and move it across to `In progress`.
  - Make a branch and work on that branch to complete the task on the card
  - When the task is complete and CI is passing on GitHub, we would then make a PR and move the ticket to `Review`
  - Pairs must get 2 approvals before they merge the code - a team member can [approve]()
    - The expectation is you give an approval if you understand how the code works and think it's of good quality
    - We try to use a PR as a knowledge-sharing ground
      - Requesters should write an informative description of what the PR changes, and link it to a ticket for more information.
      - Reviewers should discuss bits of code on the PR before approving.
  -  Once code is merged into master, ensure it is (automatically) deployed correctly
  - We used 'Slack' frequently to communicate 'merges' and recent 'pulls'
  -  Move the ticket into `Done` only once it is successfully in production

Then find the next ticket in `To Do` to tackle. If there's nothing left, call another planning session.

#### 3. Retrospection

1. Each day, our team would have 2-3 meetings a day, having a standup in the morning, mid-afternoon, and late afternoon.

2. All sprints end in a retrospection where our team gathers together to celebrate the work done, and discuss how the sprint went in order to make the next sprint better.
    We tend to celebrate every achievement- large or small, and learn from mistakes by having open discussions on what we could improve on.



## **Agile_Workflow & Extreme Programming Disciplines**
- Demo the work done for each other!
- Practice communicating and sharing feedback
- It is natural for task estimation to get better as the team gets better understanding how to
  - split tickets
  - how to work with each other
  - become familiar with the codebase
- Perhaps find a way to measure velocity if this interests you: https://manifesto.co.uk/how-to-measure-velocity-agile/
- Then organise the next planning session!
